# README

Seja bem vindo a este humilde repositório que irá trazer conteúdos relacionado
à estatística, inteligência de negócios (BI) e engenharia de dados de uma forma
simples e direta. Os textos postados aqui serão feitos através do R + R_markdown
que gerará um arquivo PDF ao final. O código usado nos textos será disponibilizado
através dos arquivos .MD, desta forma vc poderá ver como algo foi construído e
reconstruir em sua máquina (algo que costumam chamar de pesquisa reprodutível).

Hello, welcome to this humble repository focused on R code that generates
.PDF files with content related to statistics and data analytics. The content
is published in PT-BR in order to help brazilian people on the journey to learn
R and statistics (or also get feedback so that I can learn R and statistics).

The key goals that made me willing to develop this repository is to develop content
using R/R_markdown (I may change to other languages in the future) and focus on content
related to business intelligence and statistics. Lastly, the other objective for this repository
is to share the code that I used, so that other people can use it as well.

I've took this initiative because writing well is a challenge for me and is a skill that
I admire. The other reason is because business intelligence and statistics content in portuguese
is rare, so that this content can be valuable for people trying to learn it that are not
confortable when reading content in english.

To conclude, you may be asking, "why you didn't develop a ~nice~ blog with R package ```Blogdown``` and
a fancy ```hugo theme```?". Honestly, I've tried it first but after some time I've realized that I was
putting too much attention on the design if the blog and working to adjust the design and details of the blog
was becoming a bottleneck. So I took the decision to learn a little bit of Latex and created a PDF layout
to be generated from my R_markdown code. Now I don't have to worry about the design, a lot of
bugs and techinical issues are gone and I can focus on writing the content.
