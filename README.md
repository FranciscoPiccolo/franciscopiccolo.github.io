# README

Hello, welcome to this humble repository focused on R code that generates
.PDF files with content related to statistics and data analytics. The content
is published in PT-BR in order to help brazilian people on the journey to learn
R and statistics.

## Key Objetives

* Develop contenct on R (I will probably develop content on other languages in the future)
* Write about analytics projects, R packages, problem solutions, recommended books, etc.
* Share the code used in a way that can be run by other users (something called reproucible research).

## Motivations
There are a few reasons that made me stand up to develop this project. First, this would
be a nice challenge for me as I'm not a good writer and it's a skill I'm willing to improve.
Also, writting about statistics and problems related to analytics is something that will
help me on my career as well. Secondly, there are not so many content about R and
analytics in portuguese, so the content being displayed here can help others on the journey.

Besides that, I could have created a ~nice~ blog with the R package ```Blogdown``` and ```Hugo themes```
but after spending some time working on a blog I realized that the design aspect of it was removing
my attention from the most important part of the project, that is to write good stuff in a simple way. Then
I decided to understand a little better about Latex and develop the content on PDF format, so that
I don't waste time trying to make the blog page prettier.
